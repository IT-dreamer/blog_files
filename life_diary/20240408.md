## The comment
1. Today's GHR training was talking about Rakuten shugi, 5 success principle and the importance of diversity. Especially I made the sense that we can solve the issues in different angles from entering the diversity team.  
2. 5 principles are the method that achieve our goals. My goal is easy, just complete and do the work best in time. To achieve my goal "Always Improve, Always Advance" is my best weapon to get them done.
