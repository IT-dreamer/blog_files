### Comment
I was so excited to have the lessons about tax structure, which I knew about what is consumption tax and individual tax. From this lesson I realize everyone need to know what kind of tax in their salary so that better be avoid tax reasonably.
Next, I have the message about attendence record which about someone inputted some wrong data on it and asked to change them. Because I am the only one who noticed the messages so I notified my teammate immediatley and felt a huge sense of accomplishment.
